## This is individual Assignment

## The workflow:

Step 1: Clone this repository 
    https://github.com/Bezzanin/SOA_Assignment.git

Step 2: Add Firebase to the Project
    https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup

Step 3: Move you json data to Firebase:

Step 4: Retrieve the exercises data from firebase:

In exercises.html line 9 you get the data from locas json file
    `<script src="app.json"></script>`

You should change it so you get data from firebase:
    https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/retrieve-data
    (P.S Look the guide for NODE.JS)

Step 5: Retrieve Programs and machines in the same way:

Step 6: Upload your results to GitHub repository:

    https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/

    (If you are not able to upload it to github you cand just zip it, but you will have lower mark)

Step 7: Upload link to Moodle for the SOA Final Assignment
